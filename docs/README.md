# How to Become a dApp Developer

This bootcamp is designed to provide developers with essential skills to develop decentralized applications (dApps) that engage with the Solana blockchain. The course spans six weeks, with each week focusing on a distinct aspect of dApp development. Participants will be challenged weekly, with solutions revealed at each week's end.

## Lesson #1: Understanding and Building dApps on the Blockchain

In this lesson, we explore the dynamic world of blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps), focusing on the Solana blockchain. Starting with a historical perspective on finance and banking, we delve into the principles of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. The lesson then shifts to practical skills in frontend development for dApps, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Angular framework. By integrating theoretical knowledge with hands-on development techniques, this lesson equips learners with a comprehensive understanding of creating and deploying user-friendly dApps on the Solana platform.

## Lesson #2: Mastering Wallet Integration and Blockchain Data on Solana

In this lesson, we explore wallet integration, encryption, and blockchain data access, focusing on the Solana ecosystem. We'll cover key encryption concepts essential for secure blockchain authentication, including the use of public and private keys in various wallet technologies, particularly for Solana. The lesson includes understanding RPCs' role in dApps and an introduction to the Shyft framework for secure blockchain ecosystems. We then delve into querying Solana's blockchain for wallet balances and transaction histories, using both native tools and third-party indexers. Through practical exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience in integrating and displaying blockchain data in a dApp, providing a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of blockchain technology.

## Lesson #3: Creating and Processing Transactions

Focusing on the transaction lifecycle within the Solana blockchain, this lesson will guide participants through the steps of creating, signing, and broadcasting transactions. We'll explore the components of a Solana transaction, including fees, signatures, and smart contract interactions. The session will include a detailed walkthrough of crafting a transaction in a dApp, from initialization to confirmation, with an emphasis on security and efficiency.

## Lesson #4: Implementing Payment Features with Solana Pay

The final lesson concentrates on implementing payment features in dApps using Solana. We'll start by understanding the design and thought process behind creating Payment Requests, followed by a deep dive into the technical aspects of their implementation. A significant portion of the lesson will be dedicated to Solana Pay, a protocol for seamless cryptocurrency payments. We'll explore its integration into dApps, focusing on enhancing user experience and transaction efficiency. The session will conclude with a project where participants build a simple checkout system using Solana Pay.
