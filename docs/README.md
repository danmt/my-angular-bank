# How to Become a dApp Developer

This bootcamp is designed to provide developers with essential skills to develop decentralized applications (dApps) that engage with the Solana blockchain. The course spans six weeks, with each week focusing on a distinct aspect of dApp development. Participants will be challenged weekly, with solutions revealed at each week's end.

## Lesson #1: Understanding and Building dApps on the Blockchain

In this lesson, we explore the dynamic world of blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps), focusing on the Solana blockchain. Starting with a historical perspective on finance and banking, we delve into the principles of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. The lesson then shifts to practical skills in frontend development for dApps, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Angular framework. By integrating theoretical knowledge with hands-on development techniques, this lesson equips learners with a comprehensive understanding of creating and deploying user-friendly dApps on the Solana platform.

## Lesson #2: Mastering Wallet Integration and Blockchain Data on Solana

In this comprehensive lesson, we delve into the essential aspects of wallet integration, encryption, and accessing blockchain data, with a specific focus on the Solana ecosystem. We begin by unraveling the core concepts of encryption, fundamental for secure authentication in blockchain technology. You'll learn about public and private keys and their application in various wallet technologies, especially in Solana's context. The lesson also covers Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and their role in dApps, alongside an introduction to Shyft for building secure blockchain ecosystems. Moving forward, we'll explore Solana's unique data structures, teaching you how to effectively query the blockchain for wallet balances and transaction histories. This includes practical exercises using Solana's native tools and third-party indexers, culminating in a hands-on experience in integrating and displaying blockchain data within a dApp. This lesson is designed to equip learners with a robust understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of blockchain technology.

## Lesson #3: Creating and Processing Transactions

Focusing on the transaction lifecycle within the Solana blockchain, this lesson will guide participants through the steps of creating, signing, and broadcasting transactions. We'll explore the components of a Solana transaction, including fees, signatures, and smart contract interactions. The session will include a detailed walkthrough of crafting a transaction in a dApp, from initialization to confirmation, with an emphasis on security and efficiency.

## Lesson #4: Implementing Payment Features with Solana Pay

The final lesson concentrates on implementing payment features in dApps using Solana. We'll start by understanding the design and thought process behind creating Payment Requests, followed by a deep dive into the technical aspects of their implementation. A significant portion of the lesson will be dedicated to Solana Pay, a protocol for seamless cryptocurrency payments. We'll explore its integration into dApps, focusing on enhancing user experience and transaction efficiency. The session will conclude with a project where participants build a simple checkout system using Solana Pay.
