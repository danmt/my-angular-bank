# How to Become a dApp Developer

This bootcamp is designed to provide developers with essential skills to develop decentralized applications (dApps) that engage with the Solana blockchain. The course spans six weeks, with each week focusing on a distinct aspect of dApp development. Participants will be challenged weekly, with solutions revealed at each week's end.

## Lesson #1: Introduction to Blockchain and dApps

In this introductory lesson, we'll embark on a journey through the history of banking and finance, leading up to the revolutionary blockchain era. We'll explore the concepts of decentralized finance and how it contrasts with traditional financial systems. Our focus will then shift to dApps, especially those interacting with the Solana blockchain. We'll discuss the unique features of Solana that make it a preferred platform for dApp development and explore real-world applications of dApps in various industries.

## Lesson #2: Frontend Development for dApps

This lesson delves into the world of frontend development, laying the groundwork for building user interfaces for dApps. We'll start with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then progress to more advanced concepts in the Angular framework. Participants will learn how to set up a development environment for Angular and create their first Solana-based dApp. The lesson will also include best practices for UI/UX design in dApps, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## Lesson #3: Wallet Integration and Encryption

Here, we address the core concepts of encryption and its pivotal role in secure authentication within the blockchain. The lesson will introduce the intricacies of public and private keys, and how these are used in wallet technology. We'll explore various types of wallets, focusing on integration with Solana. The concept of RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) and their significance in decentralized applications will be a key part of this lesson. We will also introduce Shyft, a framework for building secure, compliant, and interoperable ecosystems in the blockchain.

## Lesson #4: Accessing and Understanding Blockchain Data

Understanding how data is stored and accessed on the blockchain is crucial. This lesson will cover blockchain data structures, focusing on Solana's unique architecture. We'll learn how to query the blockchain for wallet balances and transaction histories, using both Solana's native tools and third-party indexers. This session will also include practical exercises in fetching and displaying this data within a dApp, providing hands-on experience in handling blockchain data.

## Lesson #6: Implementing Payment Features with Solana Pay

The final lesson concentrates on implementing payment features in dApps using Solana. We'll start by understanding the design and thought process behind creating Payment Requests, followed by a deep dive into the technical aspects of their implementation. A significant portion of the lesson will be dedicated to Solana Pay, a protocol for seamless cryptocurrency payments. We'll explore its integration into dApps, focusing on enhancing user experience and transaction efficiency. The session will conclude with a project where participants build a simple checkout system using Solana Pay.
